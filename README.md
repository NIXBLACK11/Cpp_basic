## PROJECT DESCRIPTION

## c++

C++ is a high-level programming language that is widely used for developing efficient and high-performance software applications. It was first released in 1985 and has since become a popular language for developing operating systems, video games, and other software applications that require high performance and low-level control.

C++ is an object-oriented language that supports features such as inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism. It also supports generic programming with templates, allowing developers to write code that can work with a variety of data types.

One of the key advantages of using C++ is its ability to access and manipulate system resources directly, making it a popular choice for developing system-level applications such as device drivers and embedded systems.

C++ also provides support for various data types, including integers, floating-point numbers, characters, and Boolean values. It also provides a rich set of control structures such as if-else statements, loops, and switch-case statements, making it easy to write complex logic.

For a project that uses C++, it is essential to have a good understanding of the language's syntax and features. This includes knowledge of the standard library and the various data structures and algorithms it provides, as well as an understanding of memory management and how to avoid common pitfalls such as memory leaks and buffer overflows.

Overall, C++ is a powerful language that offers a lot of flexibility and control to developers, making it an excellent choice for developing high-performance software applications.

### USE OF THIS REPOSITORY

The Basic C++ Concepts repo is a collection of code examples and explanations that cover the fundamentals of the C++ programming language. This repo is designed for beginners who want to learn the basics of C++ or for experienced programmers who want to brush up on their skills.

The repo includes code examples and explanations for essential C++ concepts, such as variables, data types, operators, control structures, functions, arrays, pointers, and classes. Each topic is explained in detail with code examples that demonstrate how to use the concept in practice.

The repo is organized into several folders, each representing a specific topic. 

### Unit-01
Includes topics such as datatypes, operators, array, string, pointers, functions.

### Unit-02
Includes topics such as operator overloading, friend functions.

### Unit-03
Includes topics such as Inheritance Bascics, Multiple Inheritance, Problems With Multiple Inheritance(Diamond problem)Problems With Multiple Inheritance(scope resolution operator to overcome ambiguity), AccessSpecifiersInheritance.

### Unit-04
Include topics such as polymorphism, virtual and abstract functions, compile and run-time polymorphism.

### Unit-05 && placement_stl
Includes basic stl libraries, exception handling, file operations.

Overall, the Basic C++ Concepts repo is an excellent resource for anyone who wants to learn the basics of C++ or refresh their knowledge of fundamental concepts. The code examples and explanations provide a solid foundation for more advanced topics and help developers write better, more maintainable code.

## ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS


As the author of the Basic C++ Concepts repo, I would like to take a moment to express my gratitude and acknowledge the contributions of those who helped me bring this project to fruition.

First and foremost, I would like to thank the C++ community for providing a wealth of knowledge and resources that were instrumental in creating this repo. I am grateful for the many online tutorials, books, and forums that helped me learn and understand the language's fundamental concepts.

I would also like to thank my colleagues and friends who provided valuable feedback and suggestions that helped improve the quality and clarity of the code examples and explanations.

Furthermore, I would like to acknowledge the open-source community for creating and maintaining the tools and libraries that make C++ programming more accessible and efficient. Without these resources, this project would not have been possible.

Finally, I would like to thank my family for their unwavering support and encouragement throughout this project. Their patience and understanding were instrumental in helping me dedicate the time and effort necessary to bring this project to completion.

Thank you all for your contributions and support, and I hope that this repo will be a valuable resource for those looking to learn and improve their C++ programming skills.
